# Xenium 2025 - Voxel Competition Rules

## Limitations

- Your entry must be an un-animated 3D voxel scene.
- The maximum archive size is 50 megabytes.
- The maximum voxel count (individual cubes) for all models in the scene combined is 100,000.
- Only use voxel models you have created yourself.
- You may not use any AI-generated, stock, or third-party voxel content.
- The entry must be displayed in [Goxel](https://goxel.xyz) (latest stable version) on Windows or macOS. Please test and make sure it loads correctly in Goxel before submission.
- One entry per artist allowed.

## Before You Submit Your Entry

- Make sure you have the right to use any palette images or reference images you include, and that you own or have created them yourself.
- We require 4 work-in-progress snapshots showing your modeling progression. Please name them like `title_step1.png`, `title_step2.png` etc. and include them in a separate folder inside your zip archive.
- Submit your voxel scene as a `.gox` or `.vox` file. If you use palette images, heightmaps, or other assets to generate your voxel scene, include them clearly and document how to load them in Goxel.
- If you have any specific presentation preferences (camera angle, lighting setup), please include a short README file in your archive describing them. Otherwise the compo organizers will show the scene with default Goxel settings.

## Technical Requirements

- Your entry must load and display properly on the party hardware, running Goxel under Windows or macOS.
- Please test beforehand and ensure there are no missing textures or references.
- If you want to include optional hi-res renders (e.g., preview images), add them in the archive, but the compo will be shown from the voxel scene directly.

## And finally

- Entries will be shown in their native voxel view with default camera controls unless otherwise specified in your README.
- Entries failing to load in Goxel or missing required WIP steps will be disqualified.
- Entries that are identical in concept to your other releases, with only minor changes, may be rejected by the organizers.
- By submitting, you confirm your work is new, created for this compo, and has not been released or shown publicly before.

Have fun voxelizing, and good luck!
